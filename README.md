# Trav's Rules of Engineering

1. If it HAS to work, it's NOT a test

2. Simple is not Easy
   - "Making things simple is hard work." - Rich Hickey
   - https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/
   - Inherent complexity is acceptable, incidental complexity should be eliminated.

3. Failures are NEVER the fault of a single person
   - Decisions made by an individual usually make sense given the circumstances and knowledge available to them at the time
      - Fundamental attribution error
   - An effective system should tolerate a broken link
  
  
## Honourable Mentions
- Any task can be trivialized by prefixing with the word "Just"
- Pick the features and delay the release, or pick the release time and drop features

- Don't count your eggs before they hatch
- A team can handle only ONE Dennis Rodman
   - "There is only room for one Dennis Rodman on this team. In fact, you really can only have a very few Dennis Rodmans in society as a whole; otherwise, we would degenerate into anarchy." - Phil Jackson
   - "If you hold the bus for everyone on the team, then you’ll be so late that you’ll miss the game, so you can’t do that. The bus must leave on time. However, sometimes you’ll have a player that’s so good that you hold the bus for him, but only him." - John Madden
- Dunning-Kruger Effect: ~90% of people will consider themselves "Above-Average" at a given task
- Code is a liability. If you can solve a problem without any code, consider doing so

## Time Management and Estimation
1. An estimate is not a commitment
2. Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law

- Many projects would never have been started if an accurate estimate was given
- How long does it take to find an answer to a problem?
